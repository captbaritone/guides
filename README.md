Guides
======

There are technical tasks I perform regularly, but not frequently enough
to accuratly recall how they are done. This used to mean, that every time
I did them, I would have to recall the magic Google query that lead to the blog
post that walked me through it the first time. No longer. "Guides" is
a collection of markdown formatted notes to myself (and perhaps others) of the
steps needed to accomplish these tasks.
